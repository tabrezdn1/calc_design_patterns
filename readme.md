# Homework 6: Preparing for Production

## Getting Ready for Production: DevOps, Cloud Computing, Environment Variables, Logging, and Continuous Integration

## Introduction
This homework has three new features.

1.  GitHub Actions to run your tests on GitHub automatically. It is currently set to trigger for two branches: DevOps and master.  

2.  Environmnent variables and its respective test cases for the app.

3.  Logging as how the program outputs information to external systems and is important for tracking application usage, security, and development, and also added logging-related test cases.

## Project Enhancements from Assignment 5
